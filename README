Required vars: secret_stash_local_dir, secret_stash_remote_host (for SSH; like "username@server"), secret_stash_remote_dir
Optional vars: secret_stash_connect_timeout (for SSH; default=10)

You'll need to have a "key.txt" in $secret_stash_local_dir, that can be generated with "head -c 96 /dev/urandom | basenc --base64url --wrap 0 > key.txt"

Dependencies:
* bash
* openssl
* ssh
* awk
* gpg
* GNU coreutils (at least "basenc", "cat", "mktemp")

This is like my "secret_doc", but with support for many documents, like in my "micronotes"

This is a personal tool so I would like to keep everything as lax as possible in the beginning. Do not expect this to be very usable for yourself, I don't even know yet if it solves *my* problem well enough
