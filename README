Like my "secret_doc", but with support for many documents, like in my "micronotes"

Software requirements:
* bash
* openssl
* ssh
* scp
* awk
* gpg
* GNU coreutils (basenc, cat, mktemp)

Usage:
./secret_stash.sh "$secret_doc_name"

This is a personal tool so I would like to keep everything as lax as possible in the beginning
